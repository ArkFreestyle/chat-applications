# Chat Applications

This repository contains toy chat applications that I built, following online tutorials/articles/guides. It's a personal project to continue learning new technologies while building useful portfolio projects that can help me at work if required. My goal with this is to become familiar with Web Sockets (socket.io) and Node for building full-stack web applications.

## Project 1 - ChatCord
ChatCord is a real-time chat application where users can join different rooms and chat with others. No sign ups required. It can be thought of as similar to Omegle or the old Gabbly chat (I'm not sure if that's a thing anymore...). The core chat-related functionality exists, but keep in mind there is no safety or sanitization of inputs. This means that you can use HTML tags in chat and do a lot of cool things. It also means there's probably a lot of potential vulnerabilities that hacker-minded users could take advantage of. Regardless, this is still an engaging and enjoyable project to grasp the fundamentals of creating a straightforward yet effective chat application, which can be further expanded upon.
